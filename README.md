# MyToken

A simple smart contract for creating and managing a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

This is the Smart Contract of Solidity defining a custom token named "NFTb Token" with an abbreviation "NFTB". The contract has the minting of new tokens with an increase in the total supply and the burning of tokens to decrease the total supply. It keeps track of the mapping of addresses with their respective token balances.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this contract, This can be done using the online version of the Solidity IDE, known as Remix.

1. Go to the Remix website at Remix Ethereum.
2. Create a new file by clicking on the “+” icon in the left-hand sidebar.
3. Save the file with a .sol extension

### Executing program

1. Copy and paste the code `Token_Sol.sol` file

### Compile the code

- Click on the “Solidity Compiler” tab in the left-hand sidebar.
- Ensure the “Compiler” option is set to a compatible version.
- Click on the "Compile `Token_Sol.sol`" button or check the "Auto-compile" for automatic compiling of the code.

### Deploying and run the contract

- Click on the “Deploy & Run Transactions” tab in the left-hand sidebar.
- Make sure the "contract" is set to "MyToken" with your file.
- Click on the “Deploy” button.

### Contract interaction

- Click on the drop-down deployed “MyToken” contract.
- Use the `mint` and `burn` functions to manage the token supply.

## Help

- Check your Solidity compiler version.
